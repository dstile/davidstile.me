    <p class="p2"><strong>Who we are</strong>?</p>
    <p class="p2">We are an Inter-campus initiative founded by medical students in 2002 to  promote social responsibility in healthcare workers through exploring  international health issues.&nbsp; HIA is a  component of the student alliance GlobalREACH, whose mission is to facilitate  health research, education, and collaboration. HIA is comprised of students from the  U-M School of Medicine, School of Public Health, College of Engineering,  and the School of Literature, Sciences, and the Arts (LSA).&nbsp; Our organization challenges students to  explore and create unique solutions to global health problems and provides them  with an opportunity to implement these solutions.</p>
    <p class="p2">HIA is currently working with a small village of 1400 people called Rancho al Medio in the Dominican Republic.&nbsp; The population of Rancho al Medio consists largely of women, children and the elderly.&nbsp; There is a great need, yet marked deficiency of health education and preventative health care.&nbsp; The public school suffers from poor sanitation, as there are no toilets, and the building is deteriorating.&nbsp; Illiteracy is a major problem, as 85% and 90% of men and women, respectively, are unable to read. Our goal is to assist the residents of Rancho al Medio to change their state of conditions through hard work and innovation. The relationship between the students in our organization and the community is meant to be symbiotic and the benefits should be shared fifty-fifty. We aim to develop leaders within our own organization as well as in the communities we work with. &#13;</p>
    <p class="p2">As HIA expands to include more domestic efforts our ultimate goal remains the same. We aim to create sustainable change through our educational efforts and develop leaders within the organization and communities we serve. </p></td>
