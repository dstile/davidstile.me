    <p class="p2">Health In Action is composed of two branches. An international branch and a domestic branch. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="bold"> Domestic </p>
      <p class="p2">This sector is composed of students interested in educating local latino groups on health issues after the implementation of a needs assessment. This sector is in the preliminary phases but currently we have plans on establishing a stronger relationship with a few local organizations and we will be fully implementing our programs in spanish and english by the end of November. We will announce the names of our affiliate organizations in the near future! </p>
      <p class="bold">International</p>
      <p class="p2">The international sector is currently undergoing some evolutionary changes to better suit the needs of our community in the Dominican Republic. In the past we visited the community primarily during spring break. We have recently constructed a comprehensive 5 year plan for Health In Action that includes sending students down to Rancho al Medio in rotations with specific goals and milestones to be accomplished at the completion of the rotations. </p>
      <p class="p2">Additionally, rather than simply implementing a educational programs and a health clinic in a setup parallel to the system already existing, we plan on working within the systems already established in the community to ensure sustainablility. Our goals also include releasing a published work on the current health conditions within the next two years. The published report is to be based on surveys implemented during the rotations in the region. </p>
